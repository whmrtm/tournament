# Project Description
The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.

This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and writing the code that will use it.

# Files

**tournament.py**
Swiss tournament operations
**tournament.sql**
Create necessary sql queries to build the database
**tournament_test.py**
Test file for tournament.py


# Instruction
1. Change to the folder that contains necessary files
2. Open psql
3. Run tournament.sql to build database and tables
    \i tournament.sql
4. Run test in the terminal
    run 'python tournament_test.py'
